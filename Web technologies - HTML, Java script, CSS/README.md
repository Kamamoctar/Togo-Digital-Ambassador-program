# Web technologies - HTML, Java script, CSS

## TASKS
Consider one of the tables created in the database above and create an HTML form which adds data to the table. Use CSS to style the form and Java script to avoid form submission if mandatory fields are empty.
Upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a single zipped folder. Ensure your code is functional and includes comments explaining your approach.
You can provide a brief explanation of your approach and code logic in the response box below if necessary.

## Explanations
HTML:

Combined forms for adding data to the Employees, Departments, and Projects tables into one HTML file.

Each form is wrapped in a <section> tag for better organization.

Input fields are required to enforce validation.

CSS:

Styled the forms, sections, and overall page layout for a consistent and clean design.

Added margin between sections to separate different forms visually.

JavaScript:

Combined JavaScript validation for all three forms into one file.

Each form has its own validation logic to ensure mandatory fields are filled before submission.

Alerts the user if any mandatory field is empty.


The table at the and on the Html is to check if the datas are passed
